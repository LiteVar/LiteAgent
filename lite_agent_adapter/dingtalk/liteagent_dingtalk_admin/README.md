## 🗺️ Routing Architecture

### Main Application Routes (Authentication Required)
These routes are wrapped by `AppLayout` and require the user to be authenticated through DingTalk:

| Route Path | Component | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Home | Dashboard - Displays system overview and key metrics. |
| `/robots` | RobotManagement | Robot Management - Manages DingTalk robots and their bindings with LiteAgent Agents. |
| `/users` | UserManagement | User Management - Manages DingTalk user information and department structures. |
| `/system` | SystemInfo | System Information - Monitors system status and manages configurations. |

### Error Handling
| Route Path | Component | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| `*` | NotFound | 404 Page - Handles requests for unmatched routes. |

### Authentication Protection Mechanism
- **Global Authentication Check**: The `AppLayout` component checks for a token in `localStorage`.
- **Automatic Redirection**: Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected to `/signin`.
- **Token Management**: The API client's authentication header is automatically set after a successful login.
- **State Listening**: Listens for changes in `localStorage` to support synchronization across multiple tabs.

## 📦 Installation and Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: 18.x or higher (Node.js 20.x+ recommended)
- **Package Manager**: npm, yarn, or pnpm
- **DingTalk Open Platform Account**: Required for creating an enterprise application and obtaining OAuth2 configuration.

### Quick Start

#### 1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone git@gitlab.litevar.com:litevar/lite-agent/lite-agent-dingtalk-admin.git
cd lite-agent-dingTalk-admin
```

#### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using pnpm
pnpm install
```

> 💡 If you encounter issues with dependency installation, you can try using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag.

#### 3. Start the development server

```bash
# Using npm
npm run dev

# Using yarn  
yarn dev

# Using pnpm
pnpm dev
```

The project will start at `http://localhost:5173`. You will be automatically redirected to the DingTalk login page on your first visit.
